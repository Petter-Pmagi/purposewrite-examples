# Purposewrite Workflow Examples

This repo contains **real, copy-pasteable workflow scripts (apps)** for  
[Purposewrite](https://purposewrite.com) – a platform for building **human-in-the-loop (HITL) AI mini-apps** using a simple scripting language.

Each folder in `apps/` is a complete “mini-app”:  
multi-step flows where **AI + structured questions + branching logic** work together.

Think things like:

- Content research & ideation
- UX / expert interview helpers
- Course outline builders
- Lead qualification & scoring workflows

All of them are designed so you can:

- Read the script
- Understand the pattern
- Paste it into Purposewrite
- Run and tweak it for your own use cases

## What is Purposewrite (in one sentence)?

Purposewrite is a script-based tool for building **guided, human-in-the-loop workflows** around LLMs —  
where the flow looks more like a **mini-app** than a single prompt.

You can:

- Ask the user questions step-by-step
- Branch based on answers
- Call LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Pull in external data (scraping, APIs, SEO)
- Save progress and come back later

…all defined in a single text script.
