## What is Purposewrite (in one sentence)?

Purposewrite is a script-based tool for building **guided, human-in-the-loop workflows** around LLMs —  
where the flow is more like a **mini-app** than a single prompt.


**purposewrite is like Lovable for Human-In-The-Loop AI workflows**

A very fast way to appify a LLM+Human process. 

Ever wanted a custom GPT with more control over the flow?

You can:

- Ask the user questions step-by-step
- Branch based on answers
- Call LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- Pull in external data (web scraping, AI search, image generation, SEO APIs)
- Save progress and come back later
- Autosaves your answers to re-use them on later runs.
- Admin/user structure with unlimited seats for teamwork and delegation.
- Use build in apps or make your own.
- You can make apps using the simple scripting language or the app-making-app.
- Script your own complex HITL processes in a very easy way.

…all defined in a single text script.
