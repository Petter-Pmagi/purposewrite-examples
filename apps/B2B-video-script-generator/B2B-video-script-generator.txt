#Text: hooks_prompt
"I want to make short talking head style reels videos for linkedin.
 
Now help me create compelling hooks for [target_audience] having these pain points: [pain_points] 
Who are interested in: [topic] 
Video type is: [video_types]  
Video style is: [style] 
Video language is: [language]

For each hook, consider these key elements:

Start with shock value/surprising statistic/counterintuitive statement
Target the primary pain point or desire
Include specificity (numbers, timeframes, or concrete results)
Use power words that evoke emotion

Consider different hook styles:
'How to' hooks
Question-based hooks
Story-based hooks
Problem-solution hooks
List-based hooks
Secret/insider hooks
Statement hooks that challenge common beliefs
Question hooks that address pain points
Story starter hooks that tease transformation
Tips/hack hooks that promise quick wins
Insider knowledge hooks that reveal secrets

Please provide 10 hooks in a numbered list. Each main item in BOLD.
IMPORTANT! Don't give any other text or information.

For each hook, keep it at 50 to 150 characters and focus on creating immediate curiosity or tension that makes people want to watch more.

Make sure each hook:
States or implies clear value
Uses conversational language
Creates urgency or FOMO
Targets specific audience pain points
Can be delivered in 3-7 seconds"

#Question: hook_choice
"Here is a list of possible hooks:
[hooks]
Which hooks would you like to write scripts for? (multi choice is ok like 1,3,5)"

#Text: scripts_prompt
"For the hooks with numbers [hook_choice], write a suggested full script that can be delivered in [length] seconds including Hook and CTA. 

Remember the style should be: [style]
Video language should be: [language]

Also write each script as a set of short and very concrete talking points to use instead of the full script.

For each script+hook, generate 3 CTA options:
IMPORTANT! Remember we want CTAs of this type: [CTAs]
CTA methods to consider:
Bridge-style: 'Insight from content → Future value promise'
Question-style: 'Pain point/desire question → Follow-on benefit'
Direct-style: 'Clear value → Specific action'
Extract the core value proposition
Identify target viewer profile
Map content themes to follow-on benefits
Suggest natural bridges

For each hook individually: 
Present the hook + full script + the 3 suggested CTAs

Give me a clean script (no extra info, as this will be put in a teleprompter) for each hook, formatted like this: 
'----Full script for teleprompter:'
Hook text in BOLD
Full script 
The three CTAs

and

'----Talking points version:'
Hook text in BOLD
Talking points 
The three CTAs
