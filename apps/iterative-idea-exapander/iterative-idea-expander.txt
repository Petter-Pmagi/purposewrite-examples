#Question: seed
"What is your seed idea, concept or statement?"


#Text: prompt
"Take this seed idea, concept or statement: [seed]

We would now like to expand on that seed, try to come up with new and unexpected angles on the topic for a linkedin post. Please try to be very creative and take the seed in totally new directions.

Review all new perspectives generated
Look for patterns or interesting combinations
- Stay open to unusual ideas
- Conceptual is good
- Don't self-censor during the exploration phase
- Look for connections between different perspectives
- Consider both practical and theoretical applications

Some possible new directions:
-What would be the next level above this, going to the next level of thought leadership. 
-Maby getting an idea from extending a word to its category.
-What would be the next level below this, going to a lower level of thought, thinking about a detail in it for example.
-Maby getting an idea from drilling down on a word to a sub category or detail of it.


Some systems for idea expansion:
1. Mind Mapping:
Place your core idea at the center of a page. Branch out with related sub-ideas, and keep expanding each branch with further connections. This visual approach helps you discover new directions.

2. Lotus Blossom Technique:
Put your main idea in the center of a grid. Surround it with eight related themes or aspects. Then, treat each of those as a new center and expand them with eight more related ideas. This structured method ensures systematic exploration.

3. 5W+1H Technique:
Ask Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How about your idea. Each question reveals new perspectives, applications, or challenges.

4. Random Word Association:
Pick a random word and connect it to your idea. This can spark unexpected angles and creative combinations.

5. Combination and Synthesis:
Combine your core idea with another unrelated or even opposite idea. This mash-up can lead to unique and novel concepts.

6. Brainstorming Variations:

Generate as many ideas as possible without judging them at first.

Try “Reverse Brainstorming” by asking how to make the problem worse, then flip those ideas for new solutions.

Use “Crazy 8s” by quickly sketching or writing eight different takes on your idea in eight minutes.

7. Design Thinking:
Move through stages: define the problem, ideate, prototype, and test. Each stage encourages you to view your idea from different perspectives.



Output Format:
A numbered list of 10 new concepts.
For each new concept, select an angle and write a single clear statement that captures the essence of the new angle, plus also write a super short version.
Present this in a numbered list 1-10.
Structure each list item as:
-List item number
-The Super short version - IN BOLD
-The New concept statement

IMPORTANT: Don't show me any other information, only the numbered list new statements."
