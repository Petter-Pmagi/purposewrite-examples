#Text: suggest_prompt
"I want to register my product on the listing site 'Product Hunt' so potential customers can find it. To do that I need a great Tagline and Description for listing of my product. 

Tagline:
The tagline is what is seen in the product listsings so needs to draw the attention of the target audience. 
It could explain what the product does, but even better what pain points it solves.
Do not mention the product name.
The tagline is a minimum of 45 characters and a maximum of 60 characters. 

Title:
The title is what is seen in the preview product listsings so needs to draw the attention of the target audience. 
It could explain what the product does, but even better what pain points it solves.
Do not mention the product name.
The title has the same specification as the Tagline, but is a minimum of 30 characters and a maximum of 40 characters. 

Description:
The Description is what the potential customer can read when the click on the Tagline to know a bit more about the product and what it can do for them.
It should explain what the product does, and what pain points it solves.
The description is minium of 240 characters and a maximum of 260 characters. 

Based on the text about the product, the target audience chosen and their pain points, now first suggest possible taglines. Please list a list of 20 possible taglines (each 45-60 characters long), present this as a numbered list. Each main line in BOLD.

   --- Language to use is [language]
   --- The product name is: [product]
   --- The target audience: [target_audience]
   --- Their pain points: [pain_points]
   --- The text to analyze and use as base content: [content]
   
   --- General guidelines for taglines from the Product Hunt CEO Rajiv:
   
   Keep It Clear Over Clever: Rajiv emphasizes that taglines should clearly communicate what the product does rather than relying on vague or overly clever phrasing. For example, he suggests avoiding distractions like 'world’s first' and focusing on the core concept.
   
Focus on the User’s Perspective: He advises framing the tagline from the user’s point of view, highlighting what they gain. For instance, his suggestion to simplify a tagline to 'Listen to music through your hand' puts the user experience front and center.

Avoid Overused Buzzwords: Rajiv critiques phrases like 'world’s first' noting they detract from the product’s essence and can feel generic or gimmicky.

Highlight Unique Value: He encourages taglines that showcase what makes a product stand out. For Tempo Pulse, he proposes 'Feel your music like never before' to emphasize its distinct haptic feature.

Be Concise: His revisions consistently trim excess words, aiming for brevity while retaining impact—e.g., turning 'Essential Tools to Start Your SaaS Faster' into 'Launch your SaaS faster and smarter.'

Test for Curiosity: Rajiv implies that a good tagline should spark intrigue, prompting users to click. He likes 'Listen to music through your hand' for its 'weird and surprising' appeal, suggesting it’s worth testing.

Incorporate Key Features if Relevant: When a product has a standout element (like individualized dashboards in Enzo Avigo’s case), he suggests weaving it into the tagline, e.g., 'Individualized customer success analytics.'

Avoid Generic Claims: He nudges away from broad, uninspired phrasing (e.g., Cloudkoonly’s original tagline) toward something specific and actionable, like 'Everything you need to launch your SaaS faster and smarter.'

Ask Questions if Needed: When unsure about a product’s unique angle (e.g., CryptoMonkey’s 'Learn crypto basics for free'), Rajiv probes for differentiation—how is it better than alternatives?—showing the importance of clarity on this front.

Align with Product Hunt’s Audience: His fixes implicitly cater to Product Hunt’s tech-savvy, early-adopter crowd, ensuring the tagline resonates with their interests, like efficiency, innovation, or practical benefits.
