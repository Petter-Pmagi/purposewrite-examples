(Be as specific as possible, e.g., 'a 500-word blog post on the future of remote work' or 'a short, witty LinkedIn post announcing a new product feature')"

Of course. Adding more frameworks will give you greater flexibility to structure your copy for different situations. I will add two more powerful and widely-used frameworks to the selection menu: **The 4 P's (Picture, Promise, Prove, Push)** and **Star-Story-Solution**.

I have updated the "Framework Selection" section of the script. Below is the modified code block. You can replace the old framework section with this new, expanded one.

#Question: framework
"Now, let's choose a structure for your copy. A proven framework can make your text much more effective.

1. No Framework (General purpose: Hook, Core Message, CTA)
2. PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) - Great for highlighting a pain point.
3. AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) - A classic for leading a reader to a decision.
4. BAB (Before, After, Bridge) - Shows a transformation.
5. The 4 P's (Picture, Promise, Prove, Push) - A strong persuasive formula.
6. Star-Story-Solution - Engages the reader with a relatable narrative.
